> This Notion page deals with three methods for using AlphaFold2 in both ***local environment*** and ***cloud-computing environment*** (`Amazon cloud` and `Google colab`).

You can easily build your protein structure prediction environment by reproducing following instructions in this page.

(For BHI-members) I already constructed AlphaFold2 environment in both bhi3 and bhi4 server: you can easily use AlphaFold2 without setting a new environment. Indeed, AlphaFold2 requires > 3 TB storage â†’ *`if you want to use AlphaFold2, please contact me and use the environment I am using now`*. If nobody wants to use AlphaFold2 at the time I leave the lab, I will remove all data I constructed. 

Please feel free to contact me if you faced an error or if you have any suggestions.
